## **Recommended Fixes / Action Items**
- Fix the missing/invalid track IDs in the action CSV so they match the XML track structure.
- Resolve the overlapping action segment ranges noted above by adjusting the start frames in the CSV.
- Review players with undefined positions or team_sides. Ensure they have the correct metadata attributes in CVAT if you need precise group expansion.
